As of today, Oct. 23, 2003, a new version 3.11 of ArabTeX is available
by FTP from "ftp.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de" (129.69.211.2). 
The package resides in "/pub/arabtex/", see the file "arabtex.htm".

This server always carries the current version; in case of doubt check
the version number and the date of the file /pub/arabtex/apatch.sty.
To receive a status report you may also send an empty Email message to 
"arabtex@informatik.uni-stuttgart.de".

Please observe that we are *not* the same as the (old) "Stuttgart server"!

The identical package is also available from the CTAN server network:

	ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/languages/arabtex/ (UK)
	ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/languages/arabtex/  (Germany)
	ftp://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/languages/arabtex/  (USA)

ArabTeX is a TeX macro package with associated Naskh fonts designed to
generate the Arabic writing from texts coded in an ASCII transliteration
as well as in some other popular encodings for Arabic and Hebrew, e.g.
ASMO 449, ISO 8859-6 (ASMO 708), Arabic Windows encoding, and HED.
It is compatible with Plain TeX, LaTeX, NFSS, and the EDMAC package.
It also cooperates well with LaTeX 2e of June 1996 or later.
There is some support for Persian, Urdu, Pashto, and Sindhi.
Unicode Arabic and Hebrew support is present but not extensively tested.

The version 3.11 supports vowelized and non-vowelized Hebrew, and 
bidirectional line-breaking within insertions. The former limitation 
that an insertion must fit on the current line no more exists.
