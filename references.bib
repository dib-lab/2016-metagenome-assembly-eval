	doi = {10.1128/mSystems.00020-16},
	publisher = {American Society for Microbiology Journals},
	abstract = {Metagenomic profiling is challenging in part because of the highly uneven sampling of the tree of life by genome sequencing projects and the limitations imposed by performing phylogenetic inference at fixed taxonomic ranks. We present the algorithm MetaPalette, which uses long k-mer sizes (k~=~30,~50) to fit a k-mer {\textquotedblleft}palette{\textquotedblright} of a given sample to the k-mer palette of reference organisms. By modeling the k-mer palettes of unknown organisms, the method also gives an indication of the presence, abundance, and evolutionary relatedness of novel organisms present in the sample. The method returns a traditional, fixed-rank taxonomic profile which is shown on independently simulated data to be one of the most accurate to date. Tree figures are also returned that quantify the relatedness of novel organisms to reference sequences, and the accuracy of such figures is demonstrated on simulated spike-ins and a metagenomic soil sample. The software implementing MetaPalette is available at: https://github.com/dkoslicki/MetaPalette. Pretrained databases are included for Archaea, Bacteria, Eukaryota, and viruses.IMPORTANCE Taxonomic profiling is a challenging first step when analyzing a metagenomic sample. This work presents a method that facilitates fine-scale characterization of the presence, abundance, and evolutionary relatedness of organisms present in a given sample but absent from the training database. We calculate a {\textquotedblleft}k-mer palette{\textquotedblright} which summarizes the information from all reads, not just those in conserved genes or containing taxon-specific markers. The compositions of palettes are easy to model, allowing rapid inference of community composition. In addition to providing strain-level information where applicable, our approach provides taxonomic profiles that are more accurate than those of competing methods.Author Video: An author video summary of this article is available.},

	abstract = {In metagenome analysis, computational methods for assembly, taxonomic profiling and binning are key components facilitating downstream biological data interpretation. However, a lack of consensus about benchmarking datasets and evaluation metrics complicates proper performance assessment. The Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation (CAMI) challenge has engaged the global developer community to benchmark their programs on datasets of unprecedented complexity and realism. Benchmark metagenomes were generated from newly sequenced ~700 microorganisms and ~600 novel viruses and plasmids, including genomes with varying degrees of relatedness to each other and to publicly available ones and representing common experimental setups. Across all datasets, assembly and genome binning programs performed well for species represented by individual genomes, while performance was substantially affected by the presence of related strains. Taxonomic profiling and binning programs were proficient at high taxonomic ranks, with a notable performance decrease below the family level. Parameter settings substantially impacted performances, underscoring the importance of program reproducibility. While highlighting current challenges in computational metagenomics, the CAMI results provide a roadmap for software selection to answer specific research questions.},

	year = {2017},
	doi = {10.1101/120154},
	publisher = {Cold Spring Harbor Labs Journals},
	abstract = {Background: Metagenomics allows unprecedented access to uncultured environmental microorganisms. The analysis of metagenomic sequences facilitates gene prediction and annotation, and enables the assembly of draft genomes, including uncultured members of a community. However, while several platforms have been developed for this critical step, there is currently no clear framework for the assembly of metagenomic sequence data. Results: To assist with selection of an appropriate metagenome assembler we evaluated the capabilities of nine prominent assembly tools on nine publicly-available environmental metagenomes, as well as three simulated datasets. Overall, we found that SPAdes provided the largest contigs and highest N50 values across 6 of the 9 environmental datasets, followed by MEGAHIT and metaSPAdes. MEGAHIT emerged as a computationally inexpensive alternative to SPAdes, assembling the most complex dataset using less than 500 GB of RAM and within 10 hours. Conclusions: We found that assembler choice ultimately depends on the scientific question, the available resources and the bioinformatic competence of the researcher. We provide a concise workflow for the selection of the best assembly tool.},

	abstract = {Shotgun short-read sequencing methods facilitate study of the genomic content and strain-level architecture of complex microbial communities. However, existing methodologies do not capture structural differences between closely related co-occurring strains such as those arising from horizontal gene transfer and insertion sequence mobilization. Recent techniques that partition large DNA molecules, then barcode short fragments derived from them, produce short-read sequences containing long-range information. Here, we present a novel application of these short-read barcoding techniques to metagenomic samples, as well as Athena, an assembler that uses these barcodes to produce improved metagenomic assemblies. We apply our approach to longitudinal samples from the gut microbiome of a patient with a hematological malignancy. This patient underwent an intensive regimen of multiple antibiotics, chemotherapeutics and immunosuppressants, resulting in profound disruption of the microbial gut community and eventual domination by Bacteroides caccae. We significantly improve draft completeness over conventional techniques, uncover strains of B. caccae differing in the positions of transposon integration, and find the abundance of individual strains to fluctuate widely over the course of treatment. In addition, we perform RNA sequencing to investigate relative transcription of genes in B. caccae, and find overexpression of antibiotic resistance genes in our de novo assembled draft genome of B. caccae coinciding with both antibiotic administration and the appearance of proximal transposons harboring a putative bacterial promoter region. Our approach produces overall improvements in contiguity of metagenomic assembly and enables assembly of whole classes of genomic elements inaccessible to existing short-read approaches.},

	abstract = {Interspecific hybridization is a common mechanism enabling genetic diversification and adaptation; however, the detection of hybrid species has been quite difficult. The identification of microbial hybrids is made even more complicated, as most environmental microbes are resistant to culturing and must be studied in their native mixed communities. We have previously adapted the chromosome conformation capture method Hi-C to the assembly of genomes from mixed populations. Here, we show the method{\textquoteright}s application in assembling a hybrid genome directly from an uncultured, mixed population from an open-fermentation beer sample. Our assembly method has enabled us to de-convolute 4 bacterial and 4 yeast genomes from this sample, including a putative yeast hybrid. Downstream isolation and analysis of this hybrid confirmed its genome to consist of Pichia membranifaciens and that of another related, but undescribed yeast. Our work shows that Hi-C-based metagenomic methods can overcome the limitation of traditional sequencing methods in studying complex mixtures of genomes.},
