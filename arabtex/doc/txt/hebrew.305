                  Processing Hebrew with ArabTeX Version 3.05
                  ===========================================
           These features are not yet described in the User Manual!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

        To process Hebrew input with ArabTeX, you have to load the Hebrew
        extension "hebtex.sty" that will load several additional modules.
        After ArabTeX has been loaded, proceed as follows:

        - with LaTeX2e say: \usepackage {hebtex}
 
        - with LaTeX 2.09: add the style option "hebtex".

        - for use with Plain TeX, say "\input hebtex"; ArabTeX AND the
          Hebrew extension will be loaded.
        
        The extension provides a language mode \sethebrew, and several 
        common encodings of texts in Hebrew, that may be switched by 
        the \setcode command. One of the encodings is compatible with 
        Dov Grobgeld's editor HED, so files prepared for HebrewTeX are 
        supposed to be compatible, including most HebrewTeX commands
        (the Hebrew date quite probably does NOT work correctly).
        Hebrew "newcode" encoding probably works too, but has not yet 
        been tested. In addition, the standard ArabTeX encoding has been
        extended to cater for Hebrew too.

        Language switching:

        - \sethebrew switches to Hebrew mode, \setarab back to Arabic. 
          Remember to switch the encoding and the vowelization mode too!

        Standard encoding:

        - \setcode {standard} or \setcode {arabtex} 
          switches to the standard encoding, defined as follows:

          '   aleph      b   beth        g   gimel       d   daleth
          h   heh        w   waw         z   zayin       _h  chet
          _t  teth       y   yod         k   kaph        l   lamed
          m   mem        n   nun         s   samekh      `   ayin
          p   peh        .s  sade        q   qof         r   resh
          ,s  sin        ^s  shin        S   s(h)in      t   taw

          Note: without punctuation, sin, shin and s(h)in look identical;
          otherwise "sin" has a dot to the left, "shin" has a dot to the 
          right, "s(h)in" is the form without a dot.

          There are some alternative encodings for soft consonants:
 
          v for b        f for p

        - \vocalize (default) switches on vowels and special punctuation;
          \novocalize switches them off again.

          "dagesh lene" with "bgdkpt" and "mappiq" with "h" is expressed 
          by prefixing a dot:
          ".b", ".g", ".d", ".k", ".p", ".t"; ".h"

          Vowels are encoded as follows:

           short            long 	   defective       half
           vowels           vowels         notation        vowels

          a pathach        A qames                     .a chateph patach
          e segol          E sere yod     _e sere      .e chateph segol
          i chireq         I chireq yod                .i shewa
          o qames chatuph  O cholem waw   _o cholem    .o chateph qames
          u qibbus         U shureq                    .u no vowel mark

          The "matres lectionis" can also be written explicitly, e.g.,
          "_ey" for "E", "iy" for "I", "_ow" for "O" 

        - "patach furtivum" is written ".a" BEFORE its carrier: "rU.a_h".

        - "dagesh forte" is expressed by doubling the consonant; thus two 
           equal consonants in sequence (even in \novocalize mode) must 
           be separated by some short vowel indicator (or ".u"), if the 
           standard encoding is used. 

        - "dagesh orthophonicum" is coded like "dagesh forte".

        - "meteg"  is indicated by | after the vowel.

        - "maqqef" is -- (en-dash; a single hyphen will be ignored)

        - Prefixes may be separated by a single hyphen, which appears in 
          the transcription without changing the Hebrew writing.

        - For those rare cases where a consonant is missing, input "|
          (quote bar); this may also carry vowels.

        - "raphe" and cantillation marks are not supported.

          Abbreviations may not be used in this mode as we know of no 
          obvious way of indicating them (sorry; any ideas ?).

        Other encodings:

        - \setcode {hed}, \setcode {newcode} or \setcode {iso8859-8}
          activates the verbatim reading module for the Hebrew characters 
          in code positions 128 .. 154 as generated by HED, and also 
          in code positions 224 .. 250 ("newcode", ISO 8859-8). 

          If this encoding is used, vowel points, dagesh and meteg cannot
          be used as they cannot be represented in the input encoding. 
          Abbreviations may be expressed by a single or double apostrophe 
          (right quote). The final and the medial forms of characters are 
          equivalent; ArabTeX chooses the appropriate shape automatically.

        - setcode {bhs} switches to the encoding used in the machine-
          readable version of BHS. Add "bhs" as a LaTeX style option,
          or say \input bhs.sty. The line-breaks of the source are
          (usually) respected. BHS line numbers and comments are only
          partially supported.

        Transcription systems:

        - \transtrue activates the standard ZDMG transcription, and 
          there are provisions for additional transcription systems:

        - \settrans {zaw) switches to the conventions of "Zeitschrift
          fuer die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft" (recommended);

        - \settrans {gesenius} activates the system used in W. Gesenius'
          Hebrew Grammar, 26th edition (deprecated).

        - \settrans {standard} restores the standard ZDMG transcription.

        Fonts:

        - Presently ArabTeX provides no own Hebrew font but uses the font 
          "hclassic" which can be downloaded e.g., from 

             ftp://noa.huji.ac.il/tex/fonts
             ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/language/hebrew/fonts
             ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/language/hebrew/fonts

          This font has been designed by Joel Hoffman, who also wrote some 
          macro packages from which we took a few ideas for positioning 
          punctuation.

        - If no vowel points are required, the standard fonts "DeadSea",
          "OldJaffa", TelAviv", and "Jerusalem" can also be used. They
          are activated by the commands \ds, \oj, \ta, \jm; \hc switches
          to the default "hclassic" font. 

        - The "Shalom" family of fonts is activated by \shlmold, \shlmscr,
          and \shlmstk. Their vowel points presently do NOT work.

        - In case a font is not found but locally available, check and, 
          if required, correct the exact spelling of the font name within 
          the file "Uheb.fd". There are various variants on the Net.

        - Comments and bug reports are welcome.
